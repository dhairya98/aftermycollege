# Integrals

Integration is the reverse process of differentiation. It allows us to find areas under curves, accumulate quantities, and solve many practical problems.

## Definite Integral

The definite integral of $f(x)$ from $a$ to $b$ is:

$$
\int_a^b f(x) \, dx = F(b) - F(a)
$$

where $F(x)$ is an antiderivative of $f(x)$.

## Fundamental Theorem of Calculus

If $F(x)$ is an antiderivative of $f(x)$, then:

$$
\frac{d}{dx} \int_a^x f(t) \, dt = f(x)
$$

## Example

Evaluate $\int_0^2 x^2 \, dx$:

$$
\int_0^2 x^2 \, dx = \left[\frac{x^3}{3}\right]_0^2 = \frac{8}{3} - 0 = \frac{8}{3}
$$
