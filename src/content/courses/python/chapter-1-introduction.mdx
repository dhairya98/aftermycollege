# Introduction to Python

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python emphasizes code readability and allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code.

## What is Python?

Python is an **interpreted language**, meaning code is executed line by line rather than being compiled. This makes development faster and debugging easier.

### Key Features

- **Simple and readable syntax**
- **Dynamically typed** (no need to declare variable types)
- **Extensive standard library**
- **Cross-platform** (runs on Windows, macOS, Linux)
- **Large community** and ecosystem

## Installing Python

### Check if Python is Installed

Open your terminal or command prompt and type:

```bash
python --version
```

or

```bash
python3 --version
```

If Python is installed, you'll see the version number (e.g., `Python 3.11.0`).

### Installing Python

If Python isn't installed:

1. **Windows/Mac**: Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. **Linux**: Use your package manager:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install python3  # Ubuntu/Debian
   ```

## Your First Python Program

Let's write the classic "Hello, World!" program:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

Save this in a file called `hello.py` and run it:

```bash
python hello.py
```

Output:
```
Hello, World!
```

## Python Interactive Shell

Python comes with an interactive shell (REPL - Read-Eval-Print Loop). Start it by typing `python` or `python3` in your terminal:

```python
>>> print("Hello from Python!")
Hello from Python!
>>> 2 + 2
4
>>> 
```

The interactive shell is great for experimenting and testing small code snippets.

## Python Syntax Basics

### Indentation Matters

Unlike many languages, Python uses **indentation** to define code blocks:

```python
if True:
    print("This is indented")
    print("So is this")
print("This is not part of the if block")
```

### Comments

Add comments to explain your code:

```python
# This is a single-line comment

"""
This is a multi-line comment
or docstring
"""
```

## Next Steps

Now that you've set up Python, we'll dive into variables and data types in the next chapter!
