# Limits and Continuity

Limits are the foundation of calculus. They help us understand what happens to a function as it approaches a particular value.

## What is a Limit?

The limit of a function $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches $a$ is written as:

$$
\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = L
$$

This means that as $x$ gets arbitrarily close to $a$, $f(x)$ gets arbitrarily close to $L$.

## Example

Consider the function $f(x) = \frac{x^2 - 1}{x - 1}$:

$$
\lim_{x \to 1} \frac{x^2 - 1}{x - 1} = \lim_{x \to 1} \frac{(x-1)(x+1)}{x-1} = \lim_{x \to 1} (x+1) = 2
$$
