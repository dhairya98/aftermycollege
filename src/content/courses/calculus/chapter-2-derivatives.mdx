# Derivatives

The derivative of a function represents its instantaneous rate of change. It's one of the most important concepts in calculus.

## Definition

The derivative of $f(x)$ at point $a$ is defined as:

$$
f'(a) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h}
$$

## Common Derivatives

Some fundamental derivative rules:

- $\frac{d}{dx}(x^n) = nx^{n-1}$ (Power Rule)
- $\frac{d}{dx}(\sin x) = \cos x$
- $\frac{d}{dx}(\cos x) = -\sin x$
- $\frac{d}{dx}(e^x) = e^x$

## Example

Find the derivative of $f(x) = x^3 + 2x^2 - 5x + 1$:

$$
f'(x) = 3x^2 + 4x - 5
$$
