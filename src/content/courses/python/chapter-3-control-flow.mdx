# Control Flow

Control flow statements allow you to make decisions and repeat actions in your programs. Python provides `if/else` for conditionals and `for/while` for loops.

## Conditional Statements

### If Statement

Execute code only if a condition is true:

```python
age = 18

if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult")
```

### If-Else Statement

Execute one block if true, another if false:

```python
age = 16

if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult")
else:
    print("You are a minor")
```

### If-Elif-Else Statement

Handle multiple conditions:

```python
score = 85

if score >= 90:
    grade = "A"
elif score >= 80:
    grade = "B"
elif score >= 70:
    grade = "C"
else:
    grade = "F"

print(f"Your grade is {grade}")
```

### Comparison Operators

```python
x = 10
y = 5

x == y  # False (equal to)
x != y  # True (not equal to)
x > y   # True (greater than)
x < y   # False (less than)
x >= y  # True (greater than or equal)
x <= y  # False (less than or equal)
```

### Logical Operators

```python
age = 25
has_license = True

# AND - both must be true
if age >= 18 and has_license:
    print("You can drive")

# OR - at least one must be true
if age < 18 or not has_license:
    print("You cannot drive")

# NOT - reverses the boolean
if not has_license:
    print("You need a license")
```

## Loops

### For Loop

Iterate over a sequence (list, string, range, etc.):

```python
# Iterate over a list
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)

# Iterate over a string
for char in "Python":
    print(char)

# Iterate over a range
for i in range(5):
    print(i)  # Prints 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

# Range with start and end
for i in range(1, 6):
    print(i)  # Prints 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

# Range with step
for i in range(0, 10, 2):
    print(i)  # Prints 0, 2, 4, 6, 8
```

### While Loop

Execute code while a condition is true:

```python
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(f"Count: {count}")
    count += 1
```

**Be careful with infinite loops!**

```python
# This would run forever (don't run this!)
# while True:
#     print("Infinite loop")
```

### Loop Control Statements

#### Break

Exit the loop immediately:

```python
for i in range(10):
    if i == 5:
        break
    print(i)  # Prints 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
```

#### Continue

Skip the rest of the current iteration:

```python
for i in range(10):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        continue  # Skip even numbers
    print(i)  # Prints 1, 3, 5, 7, 9
```

#### Else with Loops

Execute code when loop completes normally (not via break):

```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
else:
    print("Loop completed normally")
```

## Nested Loops

Loops can be nested inside other loops:

```python
# Multiplication table
for i in range(1, 4):
    for j in range(1, 4):
        print(f"{i} x {j} = {i * j}")
    print()  # Empty line between tables
```

## Practice Examples

### Example 1: Number Guessing Game

```python
secret_number = 7
guess = int(input("Guess a number between 1 and 10: "))

if guess == secret_number:
    print("Congratulations! You guessed it!")
elif guess < secret_number:
    print("Too low!")
else:
    print("Too high!")
```

### Example 2: Sum of Even Numbers

```python
total = 0
for i in range(1, 11):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        total += i

print(f"Sum of even numbers from 1 to 10: {total}")
```

### Example 3: Finding Prime Numbers

```python
number = 17
is_prime = True

if number < 2:
    is_prime = False
else:
    for i in range(2, number):
        if number % i == 0:
            is_prime = False
            break

if is_prime:
    print(f"{number} is prime")
else:
    print(f"{number} is not prime")
```
