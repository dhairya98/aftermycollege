# Random Variables

Probability helps us quantify uncertainty and make informed decisions in the presence of randomness.

We define the **sample space** $$\Omega$$ as the set of all possible outcomes of an experiment.

## ✅ Events

An **event** is a subset of the sample space. For example, rolling a fair die:

**Inline:** $P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}$.

**Display:**

$$
P(E) = \frac{\lvert E \rvert}{\lvert \Omega \rvert} = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
$$

When $a \ne 0$, there are two solutions to $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$:

$$
x=\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{\,b^2 - 4ac\,}}{2a}
$$
