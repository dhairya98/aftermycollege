# Variables and Data Types

Variables are containers for storing data values. In Python, you don't need to declare the type of a variable - Python automatically determines it based on the value you assign.

## Variables

### Creating Variables

Variables are created when you assign a value to them:

```python
name = "Alice"
age = 25
height = 5.6
is_student = True
```

### Variable Naming Rules

- Must start with a letter or underscore
- Can contain letters, numbers, and underscores
- Case-sensitive (`name` and `Name` are different)
- Cannot use Python keywords (like `if`, `for`, `class`)

**Good examples:**
```python
user_name = "Alice"
user_age = 25
_count = 10
```

**Bad examples:**
```python
2name = "Alice"  # Can't start with number
user-name = "Bob"  # Can't use hyphens
class = "Math"     # 'class' is a keyword
```

## Data Types

Python has several built-in data types:

### Numbers

#### Integers
```python
x = 10
y = -5
z = 0
```

#### Floats (Decimal Numbers)
```python
pi = 3.14159
temperature = -10.5
```

#### Complex Numbers
```python
z = 3 + 4j
```

### Strings

Strings are sequences of characters enclosed in quotes:

```python
name = "Alice"
greeting = 'Hello'
message = """This is a
multi-line string"""
```

**String Operations:**
```python
first_name = "Alice"
last_name = "Smith"
full_name = first_name + " " + last_name  # Concatenation
print(full_name)  # "Alice Smith"

# String repetition
print("Hi" * 3)  # "HiHiHi"

# String formatting (f-strings)
age = 25
print(f"{first_name} is {age} years old")  # "Alice is 25 years old"
```

### Booleans

Boolean values are `True` or `False`:

```python
is_active = True
is_complete = False
```

### Type Checking

Use `type()` to check a variable's type:

```python
x = 10
print(type(x))  # <class 'int'>

name = "Alice"
print(type(name))  # <class 'str'>
```

### Type Conversion

Convert between types:

```python
# String to integer
age_str = "25"
age = int(age_str)

# Integer to string
age = 25
age_str = str(age)

# Float to integer (truncates)
pi = 3.14159
pi_int = int(pi)  # 3
```

## Constants

While Python doesn't have true constants, convention is to use UPPERCASE for constants:

```python
PI = 3.14159
MAX_CONNECTIONS = 100
```

## Multiple Assignment

Assign multiple variables at once:

```python
x, y, z = 1, 2, 3
a = b = c = 0
```

## Practice Example

```python
# Student information
student_name = "Alice"
student_age = 20
student_gpa = 3.8
is_enrolled = True

# Display information
print(f"Student: {student_name}")
print(f"Age: {student_age}")
print(f"GPA: {student_gpa}")
print(f"Enrolled: {is_enrolled}")
```

Now that you understand variables and data types, let's learn about control flow - how to make decisions and repeat actions in your programs!
